# <h2 align="center">Dotfiles</h2>

A collection of resusable dotfiles configurations I have for Gentoo/Funtoo based desktops.

## Contents

- [My 'fresh-zsh' repository](https://github.com/rkruk/fresh-zsh)
- [Neovim Dotfiles](https://github.com/rkruk/neovim-dotfiles)
- [Funtoo Desktop resusable /home & /etc configs](https://github.com/rkruk/Funtoo-Configuration-Files)
- [Gentoo/Funtoo Server & Desktop Configuration files](https://github.com/rkruk/Gentoo-Configuration-Files)

The last two will be merged into one at some point in the near future. Some of those configs (for servers) will be moved to separate repository soon.
